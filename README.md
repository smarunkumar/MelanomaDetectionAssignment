# CNN model to detect Melanoma
> To build a CNN based multiclass classification model which can accurately detect Melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  We are trying to build a multiclass classification CNN model which can accurately detect Melanoma. In addition, model is able to deted following skin diseases.
  
  Actinic keratosis
  Basal cell carcinoma
  Dermatofibroma
  Melanoma
  Nevus
  Pigmented benign keratosis
  Seborrheic keratosis
  Squamous cell carcinoma
  Vascular lesion
  
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  To build the model we are using dataset consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
